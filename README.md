# Resistor Color Code Calculator

Having a hard time to get the value of a resistor? Why waste your time by calculating it let this web application do the hard work for you. If this project helped you make sure you leave a star on this repository. **Currently it only supports 4 band resistor color.**

## Usage

Go to the [web page](https://raajnadar.github.io/resistor-color-code-calculator) select the color in the proper sequence & get the correct value of the resistor that's it. We made it as simple as possible to get the desired output.
